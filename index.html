        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside, I am driven by a passion for design and a desire to make a difference in the world through my work. I believe that design is a powerful tool that can help to create meaningful and impactful experiences for users, and I am dedicated to using my skills and knowledge to help others.

<br><br>I am focused on becoming a UX designer, and I am working hard to gain experience and build my skills in the field. I am constantly exploring new design techniques and methods, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. I understand the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies, and I am always looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve.

<br><br>One of my biggest goals is to secure an internship in the design field, where I can gain hands-on experience working with real-world clients and projects. I believe that an internship would provide me with the opportunity to develop my skills and make valuable connections in the industry. I am eager to work with experienced designers and learn from their expertise and guidance.
<br><br>

        In addition to my passion for design, I am also dedicated to helping others and making a positive impact in the world. I believe that design can be used to create solutions to real-world problems and improve people's lives. Whether it's designing a new website for a non-profit organization or creating a mobile app that makes it easier for people to access important information, I am always looking for ways to use my skills and knowledge to make a difference.

<br><br>In addition to my focus on UX design, I am also a talented graphic designer with a strong passion for creating visually appealing and impactful designs. I have honed my skills in graphic design through various personal projects, such as creating custom wedding invitations and t-shirt prints for friends and family.

<br><br>I have a unique and creative style that sets me apart from other designers, and I am always striving to push the boundaries and come up with new and innovative designs. Whether it's creating a custom logo for a small business or designing a new print for a t-shirt, I am always up for a challenge and love putting my skills to the test.
<br><br>

    I am particularly drawn to the wedding industry, and I enjoy creating custom wedding invitations and other stationery that help to set the tone and make a memorable impression on guests. I understand the importance of capturing the unique style and personality of each couple, and I work closely with clients to create designs that are truly reflective of their vision.

<br><br>Through my work as a graphic designer, I am able to express my creativity and make a positive impact on others. I am driven by the satisfaction of seeing my designs come to life and the joy that they bring to others. Whether it's a wedding invitation that perfectly captures a couple's style, or a t-shirt print that makes someone smile, I am always grateful for the opportunity to make a difference through my work.
